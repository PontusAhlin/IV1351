# A project made during year 2 of taking a information and communication bachelor at KTH. 

## The project covers the process of designing, generating data, creating the database and producing views/queries for a fictional music school.

## The technologies used for this project was Astah, PostgreSQL and SQL.

### Seminar 1:
The first seminar covers the conceptual model which was made in Astah, a Unified modelling language(UML). Also the generation of data which was handled using a data generaion website. 

### Seminar 2:
For the second seminar we were to make the logical model of the database, meaning making the tables and all of its attributes as it was to look in the database. Then we were to export it. 

### Seminar 3:
By using the database from seminar 2, we were to create specific views/queries for the database that answered given questions.
