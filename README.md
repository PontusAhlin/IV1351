# A project for "IV1351 - Data Storage Paradigms", which I took during year 2 of Information and Communication Technology at KTH. 

## The project covers the process of designing, generating data, creating the database and producing views/queries for a fictional music school.

## The technologies used for this project was Astah, PostgreSQL and SQL.

### General information about the database: 
The database have multiple tables which handles the different parts of the database. Examples as such would be the instructors, students and the contact details of the students and the teachers. 
There are multiple different queries the database can handle, some example would be "Show the number of lessons given per month during a specified year" or "List ids and names of all instructors who has given more than a specific number of lessons during the current month". 

### Seminar 1:
The first seminar covers the conceptual model which was made in Astah, a Unified modelling language(UML). Also the generation of data which was handled using a data generaion website. 

### Seminar 2:
For the second seminar we were to make the logical model of the database, meaning making the tables and all of its attributes as it was to look in the database. Then we were to export it. 

### Seminar 3:
By using the database from seminar 2, we were to create specific views/queries for the database that answered given questions. The views were created using PostgreSQL.
